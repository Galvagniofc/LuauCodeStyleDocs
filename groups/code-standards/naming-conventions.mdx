title: "Naming Conventions"
description: "Consistent naming conventions that improve code readability and maintain uniformity across your entire codebase."
---

Consistent naming conventions are fundamental to writing maintainable code. They reduce cognitive load, improve readability, and make collaboration more efficient. Our conventions prioritize clarity and consistency above all else.

## Universal Rules

> ### PascalCase for Everything
>
> We use `PascalCase` for all identifiers in our codebase. This creates a uniform, professional appearance and eliminates decision fatigue.
>
> <Note>
>   Exceptions are made for constants, which should be written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
> </Note>

> ### English Only
>
> All code must be written in English. This ensures accessibility for international developers and maintains consistency across the codebase.

## Specific Naming Patterns

> ### Boolean Variables
>
> Boolean variables must be prefixed with **`Is`**, **`Has`**, or **`Can`** to clearly indicate their true/false nature.
>
> ```lua
> local IsAlive = true
> local HasItem = false
> ```
>
> **Common Boolean Prefixes:**
>
> - **`Is`**: State or condition (`IsVisible`, `IsEnabled`, `IsReady`)
> - **`Has`**: Possession or presence (`HasWeapon`, `HasAccess`, `HasCompleted`)
> - **`Can`**: Ability or permission (`CanMove`, `CanAttack`, `CanPurchase`)

> ### **Event Names**
>
> Event names must start with **`On`** to clearly identify them as event handlers or signals.
>
> ```lua
> local function OnPlayerAdded(Player: Player)
> 	-- Code Logic
> end
> 
> Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(OnPlayerAdded)
> ```

> ### **Constants and Configuration**
>
> Avoid magic numbers by using descriptive constant names. Constants should clearly describe their purpose and value.
>
> <Note>
>   Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
> </Note>
> ```luau
> local PLAYER_WALK_SPEED = 25
> local ROUND_COOLDOWN = 10
> ```

## Descriptive and Meaningful Names

> ### **Avoid Abbreviations**
>
> Use full, descriptive names instead of abbreviations. Code is read more often than it's written, so prioritize clarity.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local Player = Players.LocalPlayer
> local HumanoidRootPart = Character.HumanoidRootPart
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local Plr = Players.LocalPlayer
> local Root = Character.HumanoidRootPart
> ```

> ### **Context-Specific Names**
>
> Names should be specific to their context and purpose. Avoid generic names that don't convey meaning.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local WeaponInventory = {} -- {"Weapon1", "Weapon2"}
> local RespawnLocation = workspace.RespawnPoint
> 
> local function ProcessItemPurchase()
>     
> end
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local Items = {}                   -- What kind of items?
> local Location = workspace.Spawn   -- Location for what?
> 
> local function Process()  -- Process what?
> 
> end
> ```

> ### **Functions**
>
> Function names should be verbs that clearly describe what the function does.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local function CalculatePlayerDamage()
> 
> end
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local function Calculate()  -- Calculate what?
> 
> end
> ```

## String Formatting

### **String Literals**

Always use `double quotes ""` for string literals to maintain consistency.

<Note>
  When inserting variables into a string, you can use String interpolation

  `` `Text {Variable}` ``.
</Note>

## Comments and Documentation

### üí¨ **Empty Table Comments**

When creating empty tables, include a comment indicating what will be stored in them.

```luau
-- ‚úÖ Correct: Commented empty tables
local ActivePlayers = {} -- {Player}
local PlayerInventories = {} -- {[Player] = {ItemId}}
local WeaponStats = {} -- {WeaponName = {Damage, Range, FireRate}}
local QuestProgress = {} -- {[PlayerId] = {QuestId = Progress}}

-- ‚ùå Incorrect: Uncommented empty tables
local ActivePlayers = {}        -- What goes here?
local PlayerInventories = {}    -- Unknown structure
local WeaponStats = {}          -- Unclear contents
```

## Practical Examples

### üéÆ **Game System Example**

```luau
-- ‚úÖ Complete example following all conventions
local PlayerCombatSystem = {}

-- Constants
local DefaultPlayerHealth = 100
local CriticalHitMultiplier = 2.0
local RespawnDelaySeconds = 5

-- State tracking
local ActiveCombatPlayers = {} -- {Player}
local PlayerHealthValues = {} -- {[Player] = number}

-- Boolean flags
local IsCombatEnabled = true
local HasCombatStarted = false
local CanPlayersRespawn = true

-- Events
local OnPlayerDeath = Signal.new()
local OnCombatStart = Signal.new()
local OnPlayerRespawn = Signal.new()

-- Functions
local function CalculateWeaponDamage(weaponType, baseDamage, isCriticalHit)
    local damage = baseDamage
    if isCriticalHit then
        damage = damage * CriticalHitMultiplier
    end
    return damage
end

local function HandlePlayerDeath(player, killer)
    PlayerHealthValues[player] = 0
    OnPlayerDeath:Fire(player, killer)
    
    if CanPlayersRespawn then
        task.wait(RespawnDelaySeconds)
        RespawnPlayer(player)
    end
end

return PlayerCombatSystem
```

<Note>
  **Remember**: Consistency is more important than personal preference. Once you establish a naming convention, apply it uniformly throughout your entire codebase.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Use your IDE's refactoring tools to rename variables and functions consistently across your project. This helps maintain naming standards when refactoring code.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Code Reviews**: During code reviews, pay special attention to naming conventions. Well-named code is self-documenting and reduces the need for extensive comments.
