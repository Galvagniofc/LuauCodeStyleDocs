title: "Naming Conventions"
description: "Consistent naming conventions that improve code readability and maintain uniformity across your entire codebase."
---

Consistent naming conventions are fundamental to writing maintainable code. They reduce cognitive load, improve readability, and make collaboration more efficient. Our conventions prioritize clarity and consistency above all else.

## Universal Rules

> ### PascalCase for Everything
>
> We use `PascalCase` for all identifiers in our codebase. This creates a uniform, professional appearance and eliminates decision fatigue.
>
> <Note>
>   Exceptions are made for constants, which should be written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
> </Note>

> ### English Only
>
> All code must be written in English. This ensures accessibility for international developers and maintains consistency across the codebase.

## Specific Naming Patterns

> ### Boolean Variables
>
> Boolean variables must be prefixed with **`Is`**, **`Has`**, or **`Can`** to clearly indicate their true/false nature.
>
> ```lua
> local IsAlive = true
> local HasItem = false
> local CanShoot = true
> ```
>
> **Common Boolean Prefixes:**
>
> - **`Is`**: State or condition (`IsVisible`, `IsEnabled`, `IsReady`)
> - **`Has`**: Possession or presence (`HasWeapon`, `HasAccess`, `HasCompleted`)
> - **`Can`**: Ability or permission (`CanMove`, `CanAttack`, `CanPurchase`)

> ### **Event Names**
>
> Event names must start with **`On`** to clearly identify them as event handlers or signals.
>
> ```lua
> local function OnPlayerAdded(Player: Player)
> 	-- Code Logic
> end
> 
> Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(OnPlayerAdded)
> ```

> ### **Constants and Configuration**
>
> Avoid magic numbers by using descriptive constant names. Constants should clearly describe their purpose and value.
>
> <Note>
>   Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
> </Note>
> ```luau
> local PLAYER_WALK_SPEED = 25
> local ROUND_COOLDOWN = 10
> ```

## Descriptive and Meaningful Names

> ### **Avoid Abbreviations**
>
> Use full, descriptive names instead of abbreviations, prioritize clarity.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local Player = Players.LocalPlayer
> local HumanoidRootPart = Character.HumanoidRootPart
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local Plr = Players.LocalPlayer
> local Root = Character.HumanoidRootPart
> ```

> ### **Context-Specific Names**
>
> Names should be specific to their context and purpose. Avoid generic names that don't convey meaning.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local WeaponInventory = {} -- {"Weapon1", "Weapon2"}
> local RespawnLocation = workspace.RespawnPoint
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local Items = {}                   -- What kind of items?
> local Location = workspace.Spawn   -- Location for what?
> ```

> ### **Functions**
>
> Function names should be verbs that clearly describe what the function does.
>
> ```luau
> -- CORRECT
> local function CalculatePlayerDamage()
> 
> end
> 
> -- INCORRECT
> local function Calculate()  -- Calculate what?
> 
> end
> ```

## String Formatting

> ### **String Literals**
>
> Always use `double quotes ""` for string literals to maintain consistency.
>
> <Note>
>   When inserting variables into a string, use String interpolation `` `idk {Variable}` ``.
> </Note>

## Comments and Documentation

> ### **Empty Table Comments**
>
> When creating empty tables, include a comment or a type indicating what will be stored in them.
>
> ```luau
> local ActivePlayers = {} -- {Player}
> local ActiveWeapons = {} :: {[string]: WeaponStats}
> ```

<Note>
  Remember: Consistency is more important than personal preference. Once you establish a naming convention, apply it uniformly throughout your entire codebase.
