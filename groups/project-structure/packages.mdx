### `Vide` - UI Library

Modern reactive UI framework for Roblox\
Repository: [Vide](https://github.com/centau/vide)

Vide provides a declarative approach to building user interfaces with reactive state management and component composition.

Type-safe, high-performance networking\
Repository: [Zap](zap.redblox.dev)

Zap provides a robust networking solution with automatic serialization, type safety, and optimized performance.

### `Charm` - State Management

Reactive state management for game logic\
Repository: [Charm](https://github.com/littensy/charm)

Charm provides reactive state management with atoms and computed values for managing game state.

### `CharmVide` - UI State Integration

Integrate Charm state with Vide components\
Repository: [Charm-Vide](https://github.com/littensy/charm?tab=readme-ov-file#-vide)

CharmVide bridges Charm's reactive state with Vide's UI components for seamless state-driven interfaces.

### `Bin` - Garbage Collection

Automatic cleanup and memory management\
Repository: [Bin](https://util.redblox.dev/bin.html)

Bin provides automatic cleanup for connections, instances, and other resources to prevent memory leaks.

### `Future` - Asynchronous Operations

Promise-like asynchronous programming\
Repository: [Future](https://util.redblox.dev/future.html)

Future provides a robust way to handle asynchronous operations with proper error handling and chaining.

### `Spawn` - Fast Task Spawning

Optimized alternative to task.spawn\
Repository: [Spawn](https://util.redblox.dev/spawn.html)

Spawn provides a faster, more reliable alternative to Roblox's built-in spawn function.

### `T` - Type Checker

Runtime type validation\
Repository: [T](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/t)

T provides runtime type checking to catch type errors and validate data structures.

### `Signal` - Event System

Custom event system with better performance\
Repository: [Signal](https://util.redblox.dev/signal.html)

Signal provides a more performant and feature-rich alternative to Roblox's BindableEvents.

### `Conch` - Admin Commands

Administrative command system\
Repository: [Conch](https://alicesaidhi.github.io/conch)

Conch provides a flexible admin command system for server management and debugging.

<Tip>
  For package installation, I recommend using Pesde or Wally as your package manager. Both tools offer reliable dependency management for Roblox development.
