## Folder Structure

The folder structure below represents our standard organization for Roblox projects.

<Frame>

</Frame>

This folder structure is designed specifically for `Rojo` workflow integration. The `default.project.json` configuration below defines the necessary mappings to integrate this structure with your Roblox project.                                                                               

```json expandable
{
    "emitLegacyScripts": false,

    "name": "Project-Name",
    "tree": {
      "$className": "DataModel",

      "ReplicatedStorage": {
        "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
        "$path": "Source/Shared",

        "Client": {
            "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
            "$path": "Source/Client",

            "UI": {
                "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
                "$path": "Source/UI"
            }
        }
      },

      "ReplicatedFirst": {
        "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
        "$path": "Source/SharedFirst",

        "Packages": {
          "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
          "$path": "Packages"
        }
      },

      "ServerScriptService": {
        "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,
        "$path": "Source/Server",

        "ServerPackages": {
            "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true,

## Structure Explanation

<Expandable title="Client">
  **The Client folder contains all code that runs exclusively on the client side.**

  - <u>EntryPoints</u>

    Contains the main initialization scripts that bootstrap your client-side systems. These are typically the first scripts to run when a player joins.
  - <u>Modules</u>

    Reusable client-side modules that handle specific functionality.
  - <u>ClientNetwork.luau</u>

    Centralized networking module that handles all client-to-server communication. This provides a clean interface for the rest of your client code.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Server">
  **The Server folder contains all code that runs exclusively on the server side.**

  - <u>EntryPoints</u>

    Main server initialization scripts that set up game systems, handle player connections, and start game loops.
  - <u>Modules</u>

    Reusable server-side modules that handle specific functionality.
  - <u>Configuration</u>

    Server-specific configuration files that control server behavior.


  - <u>ServerNetwork.luau</u>

    Centralized networking module that handles all server-to-client communication and validates incoming requests.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Shared">
  **The Shared folder contains code that can be used by both client and server.**

  - <u>Configuration</u>

    Shared configuration files.


  - <u>Products</u>

    monetization-related modules that need to be accessible from both contexts.
  - <u>Sounds</u>

    Sound management modules and sound configurations.
  - <u>Types</u>

    Type definitions used throughout the codebase. Essential for maintaining type safety.
  - <u>Utils</u>

    Utility modules that provide common functionality needed across the entire codebase.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Shared First">
  **A folder for scripts and modules that should be loaded before others.**

  - Commonly used for Loading Screens, Assets preload, etc.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="UI">
  **The UI folder contains all user interface related code.**

  - <u>Components</u>

    Reusable UI components. These are the building blocks of your interface.


  - <u>Interfaces</u>

    Complete interface screens and layouts. Each interface represents a distinct screen or major UI section of your game.
  - <u>Stories</u>

    UI testing and development stories, typically used with tools like UI labs for UI development and testing.
  - <u>Utils</u>

    UI-specific utility modules.

<Tip>
  Use `PascalCase` for all folder and files names, Keep names descriptive and concise, avoid abbreviations.

<Tip>
  Consider creating a `GitHub` repository template containing this project structure. For new projects, simply clone the repository to get started with the complete folder organization and configuration files already in place.
